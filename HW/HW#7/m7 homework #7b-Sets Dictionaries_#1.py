#Blackjack Simulation
#Previously in this chapter you saw the card_dealer.py program 
#that simulates cards being dealt from a deck. Enhance the 
#program so it simulates a simplified version of the game of
#Blackjack between two virtual players. The cards have the 
#following values:
#• Numeric cards are assigned the value they have printed on them. 
#For example, the value of the 2 of spades is 2, and the value of
#the 5 of diamonds is 5.
#• Jacks, queens, and kings are valued at 10.
#• Aces are valued at 1 or 11, depending on the player’s choice.
#The program should deal cards to each player until one player’s 
#hand is worth more than 21 points. When that happens, the other 
#player is the winner. (It is possible that both players’ hands 
#will simultaneously exceed 21 points, in which case neither player 
#wins.) The program should repeat until all the cards have been 
#dealt from the deck.If a player is dealt an ace, the program 
#should decide the value of the card according to the following 
#rule: The ace will be worth 11 points, unless that makes the 
#player’s hand exceed 21 points. In that case, the ace will be 
#worth 1 point.


#This program uses a dictionary as a deck of cards.

    #Get the number of cards to deal.
    num_cards = int(input('How many cards should I deal? '))

    #Deal the cards.
    deal_cards(deck, num_cards)


#The create_deck function returns a dictionary
#representing a deck of cards.

    #Create a dictionary with each card and its value
    #stored as key-value pairs.
